# CMPT353 Project

## Data Collection

The walking data is in the "CMPT353/Data" folder and contains Linear Acceleration & Angular Velocity data in csv form. The data was collected using an Android app called PhysicsToolbox.

## Instructions:

Required libraries:

      pip install scipy matplotlib pandas numpy sklearn

Simply clone the repository and run the following command:
      
       python main.py 
       
## Output      

In this project we compute the Fourier Transform of the walking data and plot the frequency of the walking pattern. We also create a Machine Learning model to predict the height, level of activity, and gender of an individual based on their walking pattern.
